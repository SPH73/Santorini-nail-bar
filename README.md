#Santorini Nail Bar

##Introduction and Purpose

I am building this website for the owner with a focus on providing the users with information about the service offering and for them to easily make and manage their own appointments independently, within the site itself. The main aim is to free the owner up to concentrate her time solely (as far as is reasonably possible) on the clients in front of her rather than the administrative aspect of her business.

##UX

Since the audience is expected to be of varying ability, my aim in the design is simplified navigation thus creating an intuitive site providing easy access to any information or feature the user is looking for. I plan on making the sections visually recognisable using font-awesome icons and a colour palette from colormind.io, which is an AI powered colour palette generator. It observes the colours reflected in images and produces a colour palette to compliment them.


##Features (Planned)

###Online appointment scheduling
Apart from acting as a business card and promotion pamphlet, the most advantageous feature to implement is the appointment bookings. Within the options that I found that were free, was a widget that could be added to the website. Setmore has a basic version that provides sufficent features, specifically empowering the client to book their own appointments 24/7 and it can be scaled up to a paid version if required as the business grows. It also allows for more than 1 staff login on the free version and sends interval notification emails which was initially a future feature.


###New Client in-take form
Due to the varying user capabilities it's necessary for this form to accommodate all preferences. I have decided to make it an external link that can be completed online and emailed with a digital signature, as well as a printable version to be taken to the first appointment.


##Features Left to Implement in the future

###Future feature ideas will be added here.
###FAQ's
This section includes the most common concerns and questions that clients ask.
###Have a question?
!!!!Traffic signal  prioritising??
Since it is impossible for the FAQ's'to be totally inclusive, this section would allow potential clients the opportunity to ask a question not included.
###Ask me a question
With regards to the Ask me a question feature, I would like it to be automatically added to the FAQ's.


##Technologies Used (aside from the obvious html5)
1. Bootstrap - for the layout
2. CSS - for unique styling

##Testing

In order to ensure the site works as inteneded I will conduct the following tests.

1. Features
2. Links
3. Downloads
4. Navigation
    * Avoid the need for the browser back button

It is important for the owner to test and give her feedback on how she finds the UX and this section will include an excerpt of her report.


##Deployment

In order to deploy the site initally it will go live and be accessible via GitHub Pages, however, the owner is encouraged to obtain a domain and have her site hosted.

##Acknowledgements

I was inspred to develop this project as I have a young daughter who has almost completed her Diploma in Somatoloogy and who already has other certifications in the beauty industry. Aware of the fact that she has aspirations to be self-employed with a work-from-home small business, her strong desire, expressed by the actions she has already taken to make this dream a reality, has fueled my own desire to assist her with a website that would effectively reduce the workload and stress that a business would place on her. Her strengths are her artistic creativity and her weakeness (by her own admission) is the administrative function. As much as I am able I wish to remove this challenge for her by placing the relevant features within her own website.

Her input is reflected under Credits.
