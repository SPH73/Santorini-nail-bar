#Santorini Nail Bar

##Introduction and Purpose

<<<<<<< HEAD
I am building this website for the owner with a focus on providing the users with information about the service offering using a portfolio gallery and for them to easily make and manage their own appointments independently, within the site itself. The main aim is to free the owner up to concentrate her time solely (as far as is reasonably possible) on the clients in front of her rather than the administrative aspect of her business. This site is a 'work in progress' that will be updated / amended and have gallery content added and removed when possible.

##UX

Since the audience is expected to be of varying ability, my aim in the design was simplicity, creating an intuitive site providing easy access to any information or feature the user is looking for. I have made the sections visually distinguishable and separate from each other using a colour palette generated from a portion of the header (logo) image using colorpalettegenerator.com. The colours are light where necessary and dark where approproiate. I have been cconcerned primarily with making the booking buttons stand out and seem obvious for visually impaired users and avoid too much scrolling to reach the highest priority information.

For users that may not necessarily be wanting to make an appointment but looking for for credibility, I have added three sections. The Testimonials section set as a blockquote card carousel on a mobile device but a card column on a medium screens and about give a customer satisfaction element. The About section gives credibilty and presents the owners ability and qualifications in an understated manner and a Contact section with a contact form along with contact information as well. Between the About and Contact sections is another booking button for users that have been satisfied and are ready to book an appointment.

Since the audience is expected to be of varying ability, my aim in the design was simplicity, creating an intuitive site providing easy access to any information or feature the user is looking for. I have made the sections visually distinguishable and separate from each other using a colour palette generated from a portion of the header (logo) image using colorpalettegenerator.com. The colours are light where necessary and dark where possible to blend with the logo. I have been cconcerned primarily with making the booking buttons stand out and seem obvious for visually impaired users and avoid the need for too much scrolling to reach the highest priority information.

For users that may not necessarily be wanting to make an appointment on their first visiting but rather looking for credibility, I have added three sections. The Testimonials section set as a blockquote card carousel on a mobile device but a card column on medium screens and an About section that introduces the owner. The About section gives credibilty and presents the owners ability and qualifications in an understated manner but promotes her passion and a Contact section with a contact form along with contact information included.

Between the About and Contact sections is another booking button for users that have been satisfied and are ready to book an appointment.

Throughout the development I have switched up and down screen sizes to see how I can improve the user experience based on a mobile-first approach. It was clearly expressed by the owner that she believed that the majority of her users would access her site mainly on a mobile device for the purpose of easily booking an appointment and to browse the gallery for ideas and curiosity.

The first thing a user will see on their mobile is a booking button as the 'welcome' message appears only on medium size screens and above. The button will open up a new tab to the owners setmore.com scheduling account.

The gallery is a carousel slide show on all screen sizes as this allows for the content to increase without affecting layout or the need to scroll.


##Features

<<<<<<< HEAD
###Online appointment scheduling
Apart from acting as a business card and promotion pamphlet, the most advantageous feature to implement was the online appointment bookings. Within the options that I found that were free, was a widget that could be added to the website. Setmore has a basic version that provides sufficent features, specifically empowering the client to book their own appointments 24/7 and it can be scaled up to a paid version if required as the business grows. It also allows for more than 1 staff login on the free version and sends interval notification emails which was initially a future planned feature that was taken care of.

##Bootstrap Carousel
This was the most ideal way for the owners portfolio of work to be presented and for the testimonials to be displayed on a small screen to avoid taking up too much real estate on the site.
=======
###News banner
This was something that was requested in order to inform the users of current events. When there is nothing significant to broadcast the text will be removed but the row and styling will remain to maintain the balance in the header section.

###Navigation
The bootstrap navbar is collapsible to a hamburger menu icon on small devices and expands on medium screens as per the brief from the owner. It is positioned on the left as a matter of preference.

###Online appointment scheduling
Apart from acting as a business card and marketing site, the most advantageous feature to implement was the online appointment bookings. Within the options that I found that were free, is a widget from Setmore.com that could be added to the website. Setmore has a basic version that provides sufficent functions resulting in the users being empowerd to book their own appointments 24/7. Once the free version no longer adequately meets the business and/or owners needs, it can be scaled up to a paid version, however the free version also allows for up to four staff logins so may remain suitable for the foreeable future. In addition, I want to make mention of the notifications feature included in the free version, which took care of a an item previously listed under the future features section of this document.

###Bootstrap Carousel
This was the most ideal way for the owners portfolio of work to be presented and for the testimonials to be displayed on a small screen to avoid taking up too much real estate on the site. Again, it allows for upscaling while avoiding any real diffcultly.

###New Client in-take form
Due to the varying user capabilities it was necessary for this form to accommodate all preferences. I have decided to make it a downloadable external link that can be completed online and either emailed with a digital signature or printed to be taken to the first appointment. It was not a necessity from the owners perspective but a nice time saver that was easily incorporated. The download button is found at the bottom of the page in the footer due to its low importance.


##Features Left to Implement in the future.
<<<<<<< HEAD
In the future, I would like to improve the way the gallery is displayed. Possibly with the images fading in rather than sliding.

 I would also like to add a modal. After a period of inctivity the modal will appear prompting the user to book a appointment with a decline option.

FAQ's. A nice to have fetaure for future implementation. Once the owner has a record of questions sizeable enough to warrant adding, this feature can be added.

###Future feature ideas will be added here.

In stretch 2, I would like to improve the way the gallery is displayed. Possibly with the images fading in rather than sliding.

I would also like to add a modal. After a period of inctivity the modal will appear prompting the user to book an appointment with a decline option.

FAQ's. A nice to have fetaure for future implementation. Once the owner has a collection of questions substantial enough to warrant the time, this feature can be added.

###Future feature ideas will be added here as they come up.
In the future, as the content and business grows, the site will be split into individual pages and have additional pages added such as a Products page as the owner is planning her own line of products that she will advertise and sell from her site. Shopify and PayPal are the technologies that are currently drafted into the plans for this.

#Technologies used
1.HTML5
2. Bootstrap - for the grid layout, components and styling
3. CSS - for unique styling
4. Netlify for deployment and making the contact form work without server interaction and secure from spamming.

##Testing   -------------||||||||||||||| still to add||||||||||||||||||||||||||---------------

In order to ensure the site works as inteneded I will conduct the following tests.

1. Features
2. Links
3. Downloads
4. Navigation
    * Avoid the need for the browser back button

It is important for the owner to test and give her feedback on how she finds the design from a UX perspective and this section will include an excerpt of her report.


##Deployment

The site is deployed on Netlify as well as GitHub pages both froom the master branch and will update automatically upon new commits


##Credits
<<<<<<< HEAD
I have used the documentation and/or tutorials in getbootstrap.com, w3schools.com and netlify in order to produce this site as well the mini-project and resume project from the Full Stack Web Development Course from Code Institute. 
The footer Icons I really liked in the resume project and felt that they fitted the site well and have used them only modifying the colours.
The alert banner from the mini-project gave me the idea to use a news banner for this site however I wrote the code myself using some bootstrap classes and CSS.
The header image artwork was created by BackToBack?? 
The New Client In-take Form was created by the owner of the website.
###media
The gallery is the owners work portfolio which includes live photos.
###Testimonials
The testimonials are currently ficticious; written by me (based on my own experience of her service), as I await legitimate ones from current clients.
The About me Bio was written by me as I am knowledgable of the owners progression in her career, since she is my daughter.

##Acknowledgements

<<<<<<< HEAD
I was inspred to develop this project as I have a young daughter who has just completed her Diploma in Somatoloogy and who already has other certifications in the beauty industry. Aware of the fact that she has aspirations to be self-employed with a work-from-home small business, her strong desire, expressed by the actions she has already taken to make this dream a reality, has fueled my own desire to assist her with a website that would effectively reduce the workload and stress that a business would place on her. Her strengths are her artistic creativity and her weakeness (by her own admission) is the administrative function. As much as I am able, I wish to remove this challenge for her by placing the relevant features within her own website.

When I broached the subject of making her a website for my Milestone 1 Project, she was extremely enthusiastic and has been reviewing the project development throughout so I feel this has been a collaborative effort between us
